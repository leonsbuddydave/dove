Really really basic graph theory JS/Canvas thing. Uses jQuery.

Specify vertices and edges in the text field. Vertices will be arranged in the order they are written.

Directed edges currently aren't supported, but that should be stupid easy to implement.

Click and drag vertices. Someone please make this part more responsive, I'm not a Javascript expert!

Bugs: Lots. Most notably, phantom vertices named "" get drawn while editing the edges field... why?
